                    <p>We collect information in three main ways: (A) information you provide, (B) information collected automatically, and (C) information collected by third parties we use (e.g., analytics, ads, sign-in, app stores).</p>
                    
                    <h4>A) Information you provide to us</h4>

                        <li>Depending on the sign-in method and your settings, we may also receive basic profile information such as name and profile photo (if provided by the identity provider).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>User content (photos/pictures)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some Apps allow you to capture or upload pictures using your device camera or photo library.</li>
                        <li>Where required for the App to function, we upload and store pictures temporarily using a third-party storage provider under our control (Cloudflare R2) (see Section 8).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Support communications</strong></p>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Approximate location (coarse location)</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We may collect or infer approximate location (coarse, not precise) depending on your permissions and settings, to support app functionality and/or analytics and advertising signals.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h3>4) Legal bases for processing (GDPR)</h3>
                    <p>If you are located in the EEA/UK or another jurisdiction with similar requirements, our processing may rely on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide the Services and requested features (e.g., login, photo-related functionality).</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> improving the Services, securing them, preventing fraud, measuring performance, and supporting advertising where permitted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (e.g., personalized ads permission, certain device permissions, and certain cookies/technologies on the Website).</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> to comply with applicable laws and lawful requests.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You may withdraw consent at any time (see Sections 6 and 11).</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>5) How we share information</h3>
                    <p>We may share information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With service providers/processors that help operate the Services (hosting, storage, analytics, crash reporting, push notifications).</li>
                        <li>With Cloudflare R2 for storage of uploaded pictures required for app functionality.</li>
                        <li>With advertising partners (AdSense/AdMob and other networks listed above) to display and measure ads and prevent fraud, including personalized advertising where enabled.</li>
                        <li>With Apple and Google for in-app purchase processing.</li>
                        <li>For legal and safety reasons if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
                        <li>In connection with a business transfer (e.g., if the Services are transferred), subject to applicable law.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We do not use remarketing services as a separate marketing program; however, personalized advertising involves third-party advertising technologies (see Section 11B).</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>6) Personalized ads, tracking permissions, and your choices</h3>
                    <p><strong>Personalized advertising (Apps)</strong></p>
                    <p>We use personalized ads. We will request the necessary permission/consent (for example, via an app start/onboarding screen and/or platform prompts where applicable). If you decline, we may still show non-personalized ads where supported by ad providers.</p>
                    <p>You can also control ads via:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> privacy settings (including app tracking choices) and Apple system controls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Google/Android ad personalization controls and advertising ID settings.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Push notifications</strong></p>
                    <p>You can opt out of push notifications any time through your device settings (and any in-app notification settings, if provided).</p>

                    <p><strong>Location and camera/photo permissions</strong></p>
                    <p>You can enable/disable location and camera/photo permissions in your device settings. Some features may not work without required permissions.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>7) Cookies and similar technologies (Website)</h3>
                    <p>Our Website uses cookies and similar technologies for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>essential site operation,</li>
                        <li>analytics (traffic measurement),</li>
                        <li>advertising (e.g., AdSense) and ad measurement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We use a cookie consent banner/manager. Where required, non-essential cookies/technologies are used only after consent and can be adjusted through the consent tool and/or your browser settings.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>8) Data retention</h3>
                    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Photos/pictures stored for app functionality</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pictures uploaded through an App may be stored in Cloudflare R2 because this is necessary for the App to function.</li>
                        <li>We delete stored pictures within 30 days.</li>
                        <li>We also delete pictures promptly if:
                            <ul>
                                <li>you delete them within the App, or</li>
                                <li>you request deletion (in-app or by contacting us).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Limited technical logs, caches, or backups may persist briefly for security and system integrity, but we aim to remove content from active systems promptly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Account/authentication data</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retained while your account is active and as needed to provide the Services. You can request deletion (see Section 11).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Analytics/crash data</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retained for a reasonable period to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and improve reliability.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h3>9) Security</h3>
                    <p>We implement reasonable safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>10) Children’s privacy</h3>
                    <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.</p>

                    <br>
